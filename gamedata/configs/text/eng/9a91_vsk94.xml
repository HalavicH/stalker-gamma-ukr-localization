		<text>The 9A91 is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilises a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings, the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel stock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The flip up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 metres range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet restricts the 9A-91 to ranges of about 100 metres.\n \n
