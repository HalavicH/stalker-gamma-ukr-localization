        <text>Butcher tracked down a mutant lair that needs clearing. I've agreed to do the dirty work of flushing it out.</text>

        <text>Hmm. I've scouted out a mutant den that could do with clearing. It's starting to give local stalkers some trouble, but a well-prepared hunter shouldn't have any issue flushing it out. So, feel like some hunting today? I'll pay you for your skill, and you can sell me any meats or trophies you've collected once you get back.</text>

        <text>On occasion, I cure mutant meats and send them off to Barkeep and other traders to help them supplement their imported food. Right now, I'm looking to prepare meat to send off wholesale. If you can bring me the raw goods for this, it'll mean some good cash in your pocket.</text>

        <text>Ah, brilliant! These meats may look disgusting now, but just you wait until they're prepared. They'll be delicious!</text>
