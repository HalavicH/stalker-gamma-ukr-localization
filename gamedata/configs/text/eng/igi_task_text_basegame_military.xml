            can contact for anomaly-diving supplies. No more, no less. One is sandwiched between
            Duty thugs, military goons, and who knows what else. The other is a light jog away
            from Pripyat. And both...are sponsored by the very government we fight against. We
            need to start stockpiling new artefact hunting equipment NOW in case either of those
            places suddenly becomes cut off from our runners. I need you to begin gathering Bear
            detectors and artefact containers wholesale. I understand everything I'm requesting
            will take a while to obtain. Don't fret, your payment will be adequate. If you go the
            extra mile and get some batteries, you'll even get a bonus, too. So, you in?

            A drug-making kit is required by Solid for his work on medical supplies. I should
            bring it back to him if I find one.

            Maintaining what's left from medical supplies storage with this number of injuries I
            have to treat on daily basis is worrying. I'm gonna run out of bandages and medkits
            soon or later. I need you to find me one of those old drug-making kits. They will
            come in handy for sure.
