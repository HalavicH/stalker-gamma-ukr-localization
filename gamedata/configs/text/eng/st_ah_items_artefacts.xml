	<string id = "st_af_ah_o1_descr">
		<text>An almost-formed artifact, consisting of an alloy made of mostly Iron, Bismuth, Cadmium and Nickel. Created in fire anomalies, it has no useful properties and most stalkers see it as common junk. The only remarkable feature about this object is its very peculiar shape. Due to trace amounts of radiation, it is unsuitable as a souvenir outside of the zone and is of no significant value.</text>

		<text>A lump of shriveled clay and organic debris. Separation of individual lumps of material seems impossible, due to the presence of some unknown and incredibly strong binding agent. Some scientists have proposed that the artifact is held together by gravitational anomalies contained within, however this is yet to be proven. The Geiger counter seems to barely make a sound when holding it close to this strange artifact.</text>
