		<text>Fast burning double-base propellant for use in shotguns and small handgun rounds. This variant of smokeless powder produces less overall energy than slower powders but burns more cleanly and quickly.</text>

		<text>Propellant, Small Rifle</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_powder_rifle_desc">
		<text>IMR propellant for light rifle cartridges and some heavy handgun cartridges. This powder burns at a medium rate and produces a good amount of energy. Cannot be used in blowback handguns and shotguns as insufficient pressures will lead to incomplete burning, causing fouling.</text>

		<text>Propellant, Rifle</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_powder_mag_desc">
		<text>High-yield, slow burning ball propellant for large rifle rounds. This powder yields the most energy and burns the slowest, thus it is only suitable for use in large caliber rifle ammunition fired from long-barrel weapons.</text>

	<string id="st_handgun_ap_rounds_desc">
		<text>Variously sized handgun rounds salvaged from ammunition. These have alloy penetrators embedded in the bullet. Handgun rounds are usually too slow to penetrate armor, even with penetrators, unless an overpressure powder charge is used or the bullet is designed specially for penetrating armor, like the 5.7x28 round.</text>
