		<text>I heard that I can exchange armors of other factions for ones of our own faction, right?</text>
	</string>

		<text>You heard right stalker. I will give you some armors that are about the same kind than the one you have in your posession, but only if they come from other factions. This is limited by our own faction stock indeed. 
		Remember that if your armor is in bad shape, I will not give you a prestine one eh? It's not Babushka's house here. 
		You give me a random pile of crap, I will give you a scavenged, rusty and smelly armor some of our stalkers brought the other day. 
		On the other hand, if your armor is in good shape, I will give you a shiny new outfit ok? 
		By the way, this service is not free. You can check the prices on the bilboard over there. Consider the cost as a fee for the whole service to run since we repair some of the armors, and as a donation for our faction to prosper. 
		So, which type of armor do you want to trade? I will check if you have an outfit matching what you seek.</text>
