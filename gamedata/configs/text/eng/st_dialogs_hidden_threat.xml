        <text>Greetings, Comrade Colonel! Milstalker %s has arrived at your command!</text>
    </string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_1_0">
	    <text>At ease, soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_1_1">
        <text>Listen carefully, we've received information from an informant in the mercenary ranks. A strange visitor has arrived at the base in Dead City. Strange in that the informant couldn't identify the visitor's faction. On the surface well-equipped and equipped special, but the informant claims that he is not a mercenary. He took some case from Dushman and left, avoiding contact with outsiders. Your job is to find out who this visitor is and what he's doing in the Zone. Is that clear?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_2_1">
	    <text>I have questions about the mission commander.</text>

	    <text>Any recommendations as to where to start looking?</text>

	    <text>Why are we and not SSU doing this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_6_1">
	    <text>Any idea who this visitor is?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_7_1">
	    <text>Did I miss something, can I get a briefing first?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_8_1">
	    <text>There was a report of an attack on a stalker camp in Darkscape a few days ago. Only one survived. He's at the farmhouse on Cordon. There was no mention of attackers. The attackers could have been anyone, bandits, mercs and other scum, or someone connected to our case. Find a way to talk to a surviving stalker and find out more about the attack. It's no big deal, an ordinary event in the Zone, but that's all we've got.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_9_1">
	    <text>I sent a report to headquarters, and enclosed all the information given by the informant. It could take weeks for them to get the SSU operative into the Zone. I got a bad feeling, fighter, that we're running out of time. Something's going on, and it's something trying to hide from our eyes. That's why we'll act on our own, on my own responsibility. You're one of the most experienced military officers, there's no one else I can give this assignment to.</text>

	    <text>And Colonel Degtyarev, he's SSU?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_11_1">
	    <text>The other day Colonel Degtyarev gathered his eagles and headed somewhere to the north of the Zone. I didn't say where exactly, you know the SSU doesn't report to us, they have their own secrets. I heard something about Pripyat outskirts. There is no contact yet, and it is not known when he will appear. We must act now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d1_12_1">
	    <text>I have my thoughts, but I'll keep them to myself for now. If the information you've found confirms my guesses, we'll talk about it thoroughly.</text>

	    <text>Soldier! One more failure and I'll assign this mission to someone more responsible. Remember this! Go to the sawmill and look around for any useful information. Get to it.</text>

	    <text>Yes, Comrade Colonel! Yes, sir.</text>

	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d3_first_1">
	    <text>Commander, I've checked the Sawmill in the Darkscape, it's strange.</text>

	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d3_1_1">
	    <text>Go on...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d3_2_1">
	    <text>Specialists were working with NATO small arms. By all accounts, mercenaries. I assume that the stalkers were kicked out of the Sawmill, for the attackers needed a base in the Sawmill. They left it, not long before I got there. It's unclear why the mercenaries need a base, in a godforsaken place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d3_3_1">
	    <text>Hmmm... I wonder... There's nothing strange about it if they're not mercenaries. The Sawmill base is the perfect hiding place to stay hidden. Except a surviving stalker spoiled it for them. All right, let's leave it at that. We'll wait for more information, but for now there are only riddles. I'll let you know when I need you. And yes, stalker. Go see Sergeant Lozhkin. I've ordered you to get new gear.</text>

	    <text>Take this, soldier, you've earned it. We've had something happen here that requires immediate intervention.</text>

	    <text>I'm listening.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d4_4_1">
	    <text>Before leaving for the north of the Zone, Degtyarev took one squad of fighters from me. Where they were going and what their mission was, I was not told. The men were ordered to keep quiet. Today I got an "SOS" signal from this squad. The message said that they were on the territory of the "Jupiter" plant and had been attacked by unknown people. They're holding out for now, but help is urgently needed. \Your task is to help the fighters. Also find out who these "unknowns" are. They could be our clients we're looking for. Any questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d4_5_1">
	    <text>No, commander, I'm on it.</text>
	</string>
	<!-- D5 -->
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d5_first_1">
	    <text>The fighters are dead. I was too late to get help. But I did catch the men who eliminated them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d5_1_1">
	    <text>The Jupiter plant isn't far, there's almost no chance of saving them. What did you find out about those who attacked ours?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d5_2_1">
	    <text>Strange stalkers entrenched at the site, blocked the entrances and prepared to hold the defense. It seems they were looking for something in the territory. It's not clear who they were, the equipment is excellent. They acted professionally. Here, a chevron for one of them, the insignia is unfamiliar to me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d5_3_1">
	    <text>Hmm... But it's familiar to me. So my hunch is confirmed. Listen carefully, soldier. Now there is an International Study Group in the Zone, in abbreviated form - ISG. Created and exists under the auspices of the UN, but de facto largely controlled by the United States. They work in the Zone quite officially, but if we're talking about eggheads. So, fighter, do your stalkers look like eggheads? That's just it, they don't. They are the fighting wing of the ISG, and they are in the Zone illegally. Illegally, because Ukraine has not allowed international organizations to allow the presence of militarized groups on its territory. The ISG mercenaries, who were sniffing around at the "Jupiter" plant and bumped into ours, most likely it was a chance meeting and they were exposed. Now we know who we're dealing with, it remains to find out: what they forgot in the Zone. As long as the fighter is free, good job. I'll let you know when I need you.</text>

	    <text>I've got a commander!</text>

	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_first_1">
	    <text>Commander, I've got something!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_1_1">
	    <text>Well, let's make it short, what's on it and where did you get it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_2_1">
	    <text>I was on Kirillov's orders, at our facility, which we guard. The factory above X-18. At the time of my presence, the facility was attacked by ISG, the attack was repulsed, one of the ISG specialists was found with a PDA, on a flash drive part of the information from this PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_3_1">
	    <text>Go on...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_4_1">
	    <text>The flash drive contains maps of the Zone. Where they got them, it's not clear. On the maps are marked various objects, and encrypted comments to the marks. Two objects I have learned, there I ran into squads ISG, this plant "Jupiter" and the entrance to the laboratory "X-18". ISG is looking for something, at various sites in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_5_1">
	    <text>Got it, fighter. The ISG probably bought the maps and all the information they need for their mission from Dushman. Remember that visitor? For secrecy purposes, the data was taken on physical media in the Dead City for fear of intercepting the broadcasts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_6_1">
	    <text>What's our next move, commander? Uh... I wish we could find their hub of operations, where they wouldn't hole up...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_7_1">
	    <text>We need to beef up security at the facilities and keep our ears to the ground. I got hints from Big Earth that we shouldn't interfere with the SSU, they are aware of the ISG's activities. Soldier... Look, there's some big game going on, and we're not welcome at this party of life. So rest up, you did a good job. I'll forward your information to SSU.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d6_8_1">
	    <text>Copy that, Colonel.</text>

	    <text>Reporting as you commanded!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d7_1_1">
	    <text>There's an SSU major standing right there, his identity has been confirmed. Moreover, I contacted Diagtyarev, he was very surprised and alarmed by this major's appearance at the base. The major told the colonel the code: "red 2," I don't know what that means, but after that, I received an unprecedented order from Degtyarev to fully comply with the SSU major's instructions. There's a big operation going on, you'll get the details from the major.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_kuznetsov_d7_2_1">
	    <text>I got it. I know this major, he saved my life in the Pripyat Hospital.</text>

	    <text>Oh... Look, I don't know who attacked us. My superior sent me to the Cordon to get provisions. On the way, I had to take a big piss. While I was sitting in the bushes, I heard gunfire at the Sawmill. All died down quickly, tried to contact with their own PDA ... silence. I got scared, man... I ran away from there, bushes and Cordon.</text>

Sent a special group to eliminate Degtyarev and capture a stalker. The meeting will take place in the hostel.

	    <text>Destroying the base will only delay the problem, not solve it. The ISG will throw in a new group, which may be more successful. Despite the fact that the ISG paramilitary group is illegally in the Zone, destroying them would cause an international scandal. Our job is to get any information for the diplomats that will generally discredit the ISG's activities in the Zone. After that, they will leave on their own, or we will help them, and no one will say a word at the UN.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_sl_hidden_threat_dialog_degtyarev_d3_6_1">
	    <text>The SSU analysts have known their purpose since the arrival of the ISG. The ISG is looking for any information that would give even a hint that The Zone is the result of the development of weapons of mass destruction and is a threat to international security. It doesn't have to be the truth. It is important for the ISG to initiate an international investigation into The Zone and, under the weight of the material obtained, to force Ukraine to give full access to The Zone to international organizations to conduct an investigation. This would effectively deprive Ukraine of its monopoly right to The Zone, and control would pass to UN. ISG, in turn, would receive carte blanche to conduct any of its operations. And we are likely to be strongly advised to get out of The Zone until the investigation is completed.</text>

I hadn't paid much attention to this information before, assuming that the ISG was supplying there. But there seems to be a connection.

While you were messing around with the CNPP group, which was also a cover, the main squad, along with their eggheads, got into the X-8 and apparently found something they didn't need to find. So, Hernandez, the head of the ISG combat mission in the Zone, ordered a wrap up and prepare to evacuate. You smell that, fighter?! I smell something fierce. The head of SSU, on operational communication, gave the go-ahead to liquidate the ISG headquarters, and not to let the information they had dug up, all this time, get out of The Zone. The Ukraine will face diplomatic consequences after that, but that is much less important than the information that the ISG might have, and if it gets out to the UN.\n the ISG chose for their base, a great place to lay low, but disgusting in terms of strategy. We locked them on the side of Pripyat and on the side of Jupiter, it was not difficult. The mouse, it's not going to slip through. Now for the hard part, what you have to do.
