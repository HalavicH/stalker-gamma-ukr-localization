		A formation of thermal nature. The Itcher consists of two separated layers. The surface is a hard, dense metamorphic rock with deep scars covering the entire body and the soft, yellow core is formed from an unknown organic nature. It actively consumes heat and remains cool at all times. Completely inactive and doesn't hold any noticeable properties. However, it is not recommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in the user's bloodstream.\n \n

		A small artefact formed by thermal anomalies in the Zone under extreme temperatures. The look suggests that it was an organ of a vascular plant. Further studies showed that other organic tissues are fused deep inside. The stem doesn't hold any useful properties. On the contrary, the small pins reduce the temperature of the user's body and cools all objects in their vicinity. This artefact offers slight psy-protection as it will resonate under the influence of psy-waves. On the other hand, it is not recommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in the user's bloodstream.\n \n

		This artefact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes heat and remains cool at all times. It will also protect the user against electrical currents. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artefact increase conductivity due to unknown mechanisms. This artefact is also highly sought after by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in the death of the user. Relatively heavy and dense.\n \n

		<text>
		A spherical artefact made of a red-coloured crystal, created in the Burner anomaly. It has a unique property: a constant temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit/24 degrees Celsius, regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the fire from damaging the body. A dangerous effect of this artefact is that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing it is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

		A reddish formation of compressed fossilised plants, soil and animal debris. Can partially neutralize chemical poisons by absorbing them and reducing the overall toxicity level in the user's bloodstream. Quite common and not very effective as it makes chemical burns fester. It will catch fire when exposed to open flame or even spontaneously combust. Another positive effect possessed by this artefact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. Although it is not recommended to keep this artefact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can also be hazardous to your health.\n \n

		This artefact has a soft, porous, skin-like texture. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from the environment. Secondly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy-energy and emitting it at a small rate.

		A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without. It also has a stable temperature regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents fire from damaging the body. Bubble also possesses a hefty negative property as it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly as some stalkers have reported that the psy-influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could.\n \n

		This artefact has the appearance of translucent spider webs and just like spider silk, it is sticky and has properties of glue. It can be found most commonly in or near electro anomalies and is able to smooth fluctuations in electric field density, acting as a weak resistor, protecting the wearer from electricity and reducing its damaging effects. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosiveness of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to the tissues of organisms.\n \n

		A very small artefact of electric nature. Difficult to spot. Consists of two ring-shaped materials of organic nature, hence the name. When the Ring spins, it never stops, defying the first law of thermodynamics. Scientists suggest that this artefact inherits gravitational properties from Vortex anomalies. The outer ring has a high-conductivity, absorbing electrical current from relative sources then grounding them in the inner ring. On the other hand, the Ring is flammable. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite.\n \n

Being a powerful resistor, it is well known for its ability to shield its user from lethal doses of electricity. When worn, it is also known to slightly counter harmful effects of psy-anomalies or psy-waves. However, it also hinders the body's natural healing process, thus caution is advised especially when wounded or bleeding. This artefact is also extremely light and easily portable.\n \n

		This artefact resembles melted cheese interspersed with sapphire-like stones. Only the yellow outer shell of the artefact appears to give off radiation and by careful processing, it is possible to extract the non-radioactive blue parts for jewellery and other industrial purposes as, if cleaned properly and polished, they look strikingly like sapphires. Because of this, they are sought-after by jewelers all over the world. The usefulness of the artefact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that the sapphire-like stones effectively protect from psy-waves, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to toxicity. However, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. It is incredibly dense and is known to be one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone.\n \n

		<text>
		Being a rare artefact, little is known about its properties and origins. Black Spray shares a similar shape to other sapphire-like artefacts. However, the organic nature of the stem (which shares similar properties to Pin artefacts) suggests that it is formed from vascular plants under exposure to dangerous psy-fields and electromagnetic waves. Another unique property is the ability to delay the transmission of light that enters it. This mysterious mechanism is applied to psy-waves surrounding the artefact as well. For this particular reason, Black Spray significantly neutralizes psy-interferences in a large radius. These beneficial properties, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when used in toxic environments as it amplifies their effect and increases their potency. When exploring toxic areas, it is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack. Due to the beautiful blue aura it emits, it is highly sought after by jewelers all over the world.\n \n

		This bizarrely-shaped artefact appears in places with increased gravitational activity. Although it appears almost organic, it is actually more similar to coral. Due to its gravitational nature, it provides protection against physical impacts as it greatly reduces the friction caused by fast moving objects. It also acts as a kind of sponge that absorbs chemical and toxic elements as well, providing protection from external toxic agents as well as from chemical particles that have already made their way into the body. Wrenced can generate a locally directed gravity field which increases its mass making the object very dense.\n \n

		Two disks of organic formation (commonly lipids, cellulose and lignin) with nothing but empty space in between. This is due to a unique gravitation field formed in the centre that stabilizes the distance between the disks. Any attempt to press the disks together, or pull them apart will fail due to rapid positive/negative changes in the gravitational field. Because of this mechanism, moving with an Empty is a hard task as the gravitational field increases the density of the surrounding air. The real usefulness of this effect comes in its ability to reduce friction, thus providing it with great protection against physical impacts.\n \n

		Similar to Empty, this artefact consist of two disks of organic formation connected by a unique gravitational field in between. However, the said field in Full Empty is extraordinary: all atoms entering the centre, regardless of their nature, become interactive under the unknown effects of the field, thus releasing photons of light. Scientists usually refer to it as the "galaxy effect", which gives the artefact an exceptional orbit of light. The density increment of the surrounding air is higher comparing to Empty. Because of this, the artefact is incredibly dense. Being a superior artefact to Empty, the protection against physical impacts is remarkable. Some claim that Full Empty is capable of stopping 9mm bullets fired at point blank though this has not been tested.\n \n

		This glowing artefact can generate a locally directed low-gravity field. Widely used by stalkers along with Gravi, a similar artefact, to increase maximum load. Due to its beautiful inner core, it is highly sought after by jewelers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artefact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialized machinery which minimizes the probability of an explosion. Only the outer core of the artefact emits radiation. Nightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, making it a valuable artefact for artefact hunters, even though the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it. That being said, Nightstar emits odour of burning flesh when in the closest proximity of heat source.

		Gravi is formed from metallic substances exposed to prolonged gravitation. This makes it capable of sustaining a powerful anti-gravitational field, reducing the weight of all objects in proximity. For a long time, this artefact was a mystery, and it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute-long singularity field of anti-gravitational nature, occurring in intervals of 30 minutes. A dangerous effect of this artefact is that it increases electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

		Direct successor to and a superior version of the Gravi artefact. As was the case with Gravi, it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who discovered its unique properties after a massive blowout/emission hit the Zone. Thanks to the meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and combine singularity fields. This phenomenon is extremely rare, and this artefact is highly valuable for this reason. The artefact creates a constant anti-gravitational singularity field, reducing the weight of all objects in its proximity. However, the velocity of moving objects inside its radius will rapidly increase up to dangerous levels. Some stalkers have even been known to disappear for no apparent reason, leaving only a Goldfish behind.\n \n

This artefact soothes pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds and when worn on the belt, is known to slightly counter harmful effects of psy-anomalies or psy-waves. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.\n \n

		This artefact forms in areas of high thermal activity and produces powerful infrared emissions which intensify metabolic processes, healing wounds incredibly quickly. Stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned a reputation. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, entering a psy-field with this artefact on the belt is suicide as it will absorb psy energy and emit it at a considerable rate.\n \n

		This artefact is quite popular in the Zone and is valued by its residents and visitors alike for its energizing properties, although it has an adverse effect on the body when used for prolonged periods of time. On the other hand, it is a powerful resistor, it is well known for its ability to shield its user from lethal doses of electricity. However, this artefact hinders blood clotting and increases bleed rate and is known to absorb heat and transfer it to other objects. This artefact is also extremely light and very portable.\n \n

		Shell is composed of two disks of bluish colour connected by a semitransparent material of unknown nature. This strange artefact was considered devoid of any useful properties by many scientists for a long time. Only recently has it been discovered that it is indeed quite beneficial. When the artefact comes into contact with the body, it will rejuvenate the user and thus increase stamina recovery. One downside of this artefact, however, is that it reduces the number of platelets in the bloodstream, thus increasing bleed rate. It provides a considerable level of psy protection and absorbs electromagnetic interference, acting as a grounding material but it will catch fire when exposed to open flame or even spontaneously combust. Caution must be taken when approaching heat sources with this artefact. Shell is extremely light and very portable.\n \n

		Also colloquially known as "Radioactive Snowflake". At first glance, this artefact resembles a white Kolobok. Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt, the pros and cons have to be weighed accordingly: does it pay to have greater endurance and protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to deadly radiation? Snowflake, however, interacts with surrounding energy sources by absorbing and amplifying their effects. For this reason, approaching heat sources, toxic areas and psy-fields while holding this artefact is suicide. This artefact is very light.\n \n

		A relatively rare artefact formed in chemical areas, Kolobok is highly valued for its ability to heal most kinds of wounds and stop bleeding in a matter of minutes. For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artefact modifies the user's genetic code. Though this is unproven and should be regarded as a conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artefact. However, this does not mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artefact is that it will negatively interact with radioactive particles, so it is best to avoid radiation fields when in possession. The needles of the artefact also cause small but quick-healing wounds which bring a discomfort and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artefact also weakens protection against heat and acids due to its high flammability.\n \n

		Firefly interacts with fields unknown to science, considerably speeding up the regeneration of tissue and organs in living organisms, as well as normalizing metabolic processes. This artefact can get a badly wounded stalker back on his feet in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, Firefly can spontaneously combust when exposed to potent radioactive sources and will weaken the body during healing processes as it reduces the number of platelets in the bloodstream, increasing bleed rate. It also seems to drain stamina and decrease stamina recovery. Some of those who used Firefly for its healing purposes have reported that they couldn't walk for hours afterwards.\n \n

		A very rare artefact. It's been several years since one was found. It can locate gaps in anomaly fields and is believed that it can help traverse the most complex anomaly fields completely unharmed. However, very few know how to handle it properly. It can interact with moving objects, causing some to completely disappear or perhaps teleport. It also weakens the body by draining stamina and increasing bleeding rate. But the biggest draw however, is the dangerous radiation output this artefact emits. Holding this artefact near the body will cause death in a matter of minutes.\n \n

Not only does it dramatically increases recovery rate of wounds and healing processes, it also provides the body with a strong source of energy. It is a true miracle. That being said, Oasis is very sensitive to outer sources of energy and its surrounding environment. For this reason, interacting with anomaly fields will bring death to the holder.\n \n

		"Big, red and cursed." This is how the locals prefer to describe the Death Lamp, while some refer to it as the "Seed of Satan". Many traders believe the rumors surrounding the artefact, thus refusing to buy it. Little is known about its origins, and nothing of value has been discovered so far. Death Lamp was first discovered a few years ago by a group of three experienced stalkers. Shortly after delivering the artefact to the Ecologists in Yantar, two of them were found dead with a horrific expression on their face. Nothing is known about the fate of the third stalker. Following the accident, members of the science team who studied the artefact had reported having nightmare disorder in the days to follow. Apart from the mysterious effects, the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint.\n \n
