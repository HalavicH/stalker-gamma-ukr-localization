		<text>Firestarter Set</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_matches_descr">
		<text>A simple set of pine wood, impregnated with resin. The firestarter set allows you to create a small but steady hearth fire. An indispensable thing in any campaign, because it easy to light up even in the wet.\n \n

		<text>Hexagonal Wood Stove</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wood_stove_descr">
		<text>This compact foldable oven is intended for cooking single entree meals with dry wood. However, since wood found within the Zone is far too contaminated to be used for that purpose, stalkers rely on imported charcoal as the cheapest and most widely available burnable material. The stove can produce temperatures sufficient to grill less poisoned mutant meat, but preparing more toxic meat requires the utilization of more advanced equipment. Made of stainless steel and ultralight titanium.\n \n

	<string id="st_cooking_descr">
		<text>A field cooking travel kit containing cooking accessories and utensils for use when camping and travelling. Unwieldy due to its heavy weight but is still very popular among groups of stalkers. The Cooking Kit can produce temperatures sufficient to grill less poisoned mutant meat, but preparing more toxic meat requires the utilization of more advanced equipment.\n \n

		<text>This army kettle is supplied with a wire handle-loop for hanging and carrying. The bowl cover can be used as a pan when heating or preparing a dish. The handle of the lid is designed to hold it, securely closing the lid when carrying, and a tablespoon is inserted into the special holes on the handle.\n \n

	<string id="st_fieldcooker">
		<text>Multi-fuel Stove</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_fieldcooker_descr">
		<text>Since fuels used in the multi-fuel stove are much more efficient energy-carriers than wood or coal, the multi-fuel stove is, in the long run, significantly more cost-effective than traditional wood or coal stoves. On the other hand, these fuels are usually carried in heavy metal containers, which makes them more suited for use at bases, rather than in field operations.\n \n
