			10-round magazine for the Barrett M82 rifle, modified to fit 12.7x55 STs rounds. The first stalker to bring such a monster of a weapon discarded it after running out of ammunition; enterprising technicians have retrofitted this weapon to fire more common rounds without needing to replace the very heavy barrel.
