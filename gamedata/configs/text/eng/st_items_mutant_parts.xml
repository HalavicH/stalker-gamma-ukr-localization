For this reason, at present they remain one of the most rarely encountered types of mutant.\n \n

This endurance makes their heart an interesting subject for study, but because of its prevalence, the value for it among scientists are very small.\n \n

		<text>The thyroid gland of local cats have multiplied in size due to sustained occupancy within the exclusion zone. This resulted in the need for increased food intake, increased activity, behaviour changes and hair loss. These traits have allowed the creatures to quickly displace their healthy relatives and occupy a higher position in the food chain.\n \n
