	</string>
	<string id="st_placeable_gas_lamp_descr">
		<text>Generates light by igniting a wick doused in kerosene. Lanterns are an uncommon light source amongst stalkers as fuel takes up weight and space that could otherwise be used for ammunition or priceless artefacts. Experienced stalkers that regularly travel along the path less troden make use of these lamps for their hideouts.\n \n

		<text>A soviet-era handheld flashlight. This particular light can be constructed in the field, though its usefulness is hampered by its tight light spread. Experienced stalkers use this to their advantage, illuminating potential intruders whilst maintaining their own concealment.\n \n

		<text>An object of unknown origin and purpose. Originally, this strange object emitted lethal psi-waves and was the cause of death to many unsuspecting stalkers who braved the northern areas. This one was modified by Sakharov and, with the help of a Moonlight artefact, became a source of limitless light strength.\n \n
