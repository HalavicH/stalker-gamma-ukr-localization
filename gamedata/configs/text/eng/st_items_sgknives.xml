          \n%c[ui_gray_1]The Fairbairn-Sykes Combat Knife is a double-edged combat knife that
            resembles a dagger or tip with a foil handle. This sample of melee weapons by William
            Ewart Fairbairn and Eric Anthony Sykes. The F-S Combat Knife was designed exclusively
            for surprise attack and close range combat. One of the advantages of this knife with
            such a thin blade is that it can easily pierce the ribcage. The ceramic handle
            guarantees a comfortable grip, and the sharpened blade design is especially suitable
            for use in a combat knife. This weapon is one of the most effective melee weapons
            available, and a well executed heart strike can cause an enemy to bleed out in about
            2-5 seconds.
