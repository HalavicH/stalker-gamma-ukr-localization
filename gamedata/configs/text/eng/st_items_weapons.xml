		<text>The device is a home-made portable electricity generator with a manual drive. It is based on a single-phase asynchronous motor from an old electrical appliance. Self-excitation of the generator occurs due to the capacitor connected to the auxiliary winding of the motor. The charge is performed by rotating the rotor through a worm gear at a nominal speed of 1300-1500 rpm. The device is equipped with an American-made point-turn ammeter, manufactured by Weston Electrical Instrument. Due to its design, it has quite a lot of weight, but still very much appreciated in the Zone. Some craftsmen can refine this device.\n \n

		<text>The Desert Eagle is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol known for chambering the .50 Action Express, the largest centerfire cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol. Magnum Research Inc. (MRI) designed and developed the Desert Eagle and was further refined (and manufactured) by Israel Military Industries (IMI). It uses a gas-operated ejection/chambering mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blowback designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. The advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by Magnum revolvers.\n \n

		<text>The Desert Eagle is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol known for chambering the .50 Action Express, the largest centerfire cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol. Magnum Research Inc. (MRI) designed and developed the Desert Eagle and was further refined (and manufactured) by Israel Military Industries (IMI). It uses a gas-operated ejection/chambering mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blowback designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. The advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by Magnum revolvers.\n \n

A Zeiss 1.5-6x variable power telescopic sight was added using a H&amp;K claw mount attached to the receiver. The stock was extended slightly and comes with a heavy, dual-stage buffer and adjustable cheek rest. A special set trigger group was added for a crisp trigger pull of 1lb. Automatic fire was retained.\n \n

Development of this rifle began in 1967, by Paul Tellie, a French arms designer. This new rifle was intended to replace the ageing MAS Mle.49/56 semi-automatic rifles, MAT-49 submachine guns and MAC Mle.1929 light machine guns. The first FAMAS prototype had been built in 1971 and French military began to test this rifle in 1972. Meanwhile, France adopted a Swiss-designed SIG SG-540 5.56mm assault rifle as an intermediate solution. The FAMAS was adopted by the French in 1978 and since then became a standard French Army rifle, known among the French soldiers as "Le Clairon" (the bulge).\n \n

FN designers developed a new round, initially designated as SS90, to achieve high penetration while keeping recoil low. FN used a small-bore approach, creating a round that looked like the scaled down 5.56 NATO round. The result was the FN P90 personal defence weapon, introduced in 1990 along with the improved 5.7x28 SS190 ammunition which replaced polymer cored bullets with heavier dual core, steel and aluminium bullets for better penetration against body armour.\n \n

		<text>The SVT-40 is a surplus semi-automatic rifle chambered in the 7.62x54mmR round. It saw widespread service during and after World War II. It was intended to be the Soviet Red Army's new service rifle but its production was disrupted by the German invasion in 1941, resulting in a change back to the Mosin–Nagant rifle for the duration of World War II. After the war, the Soviet Union adopted new rifles, such as the SKS and the AK-47.\n \n
