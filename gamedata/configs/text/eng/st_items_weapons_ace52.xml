	<string id="st_wpn_ace52_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 7.62x51, the ACE 52 has been built to meet the needs of the modern battlefield making it a convinient choice for armies and agents seeking advanced rifles. Heralded as the ultimate assault weapon, this rifle has been battle-proven under the most adverse and extreme conditions. Although based upon the IMI Galils of old, advanced design and performance mechanisms transformed the ACE 52 into a more reliable and highly accurate weapon for combat warfare. These new ACE variants feature better ergonomics and accuracy due to their integration of steel with polymer instead of using a machined solid steel billet action.\n \n
