		<text>The Thales F90, also known as the EF88, is an improvement of the Australian version of the AUG, the F88 Austeyr. Produced in 2012 and meant to replace the F88, this is the most modern AUG one can find, having a lot of improvements based on the performance of the F88 which increases its ergonomics and reliability. The unique barrel gives it much better recoil control and accuracy, while the custom foregrip allows for better handling. An incredibly rare gun.\n \n

		<text>Also known as the Steyr AUG Para, although that would be for the original variant that had no Picatinny rails, a different barrel as well as integrated scope and foregrip. The AUG 9mm is, simply, a submachinegun variant chambered in 9x19 Parabellum produced since 1988. It comes with a different unique barrel, bolt and magazine, although a TMP magazine can fit with it. This weapon was made for, as the name would tell, Paratroopers. Kits exist to turn any AUG A3 into the AUG 9mm and vice-versa. It is a reliable submachinegun, in bullpup format, which is why it is popular among Freedomers.\n \n
