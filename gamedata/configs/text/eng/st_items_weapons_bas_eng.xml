The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying recoil felt for the first two rounds.

		<text>The Ak 5 or Automatkarbin 5 ("automatic carbine 5") is the Swedish version of the FN FNC assault rifle with certain modifications, mostly to adapt the weapon to the partially subarctic Swedish climate. The Ak 5 is the service rifle of the Swedish Armed Forces. The AK 5C is the modernized version of the original AK 5, following the trend of modular weapons. One of the most significant improvements is the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to which a variety of different optics, lights and sights can be mounted, such as telescopic sights and image intensifiers. The double gas position, iron sights and bolt catch of the original AK 5 rifle family were discarded.\n \n

		<text>The M4 Carbine descends from a family of firearms tracing its lineage back to earlier carbine versions of the M16, all based on the original AR-15 made by ArmaLite. It is a shorter and lighter version of the M16 assault rifle, sharing 80% of its parts. The M4 fires 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas operated, air cooled, magazine fed, selective fire firearms with a 4 position telescoping stock. As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full length rifle. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs.\n \n

The development of a new rifle to replace the Type 89 began at the request of the Japanese Armed Forces in 2014. Externally and structurally, the new Type 20 rifle is a kind of arithmetic mean of many modern rifles, such as the HK433 or CZ BREN II and does not have any original features. However, there is nothing wrong with this, since it is not the originality of the design that is required from the army weapon, but reliability, low price and compliance with the customer's requirements.

		<text>The original Armalite AR-15 is a scaled-down derivative of Eugene Stoner's AR-10 design. The then Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation division ArmaLite sold the patent and trademarks to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959. After most of Colt's patents for the Colt AR-15 expired in 1977, many firearm manufacturers began to produce copies of the Colt AR-15 under various names. Despite the patents expiring, Colt retained the trademark of the AR-15 and is the sole manufacturer able to label their firearms as AR-15. Although Colt owns the AR-15 trademark, the "AR" in AR-15 stands for "Armalite Rifle", not "assault rifle". A deeply modernized variant, the AR-15 HERA can be usually found in the hands of veterans from the Freedom faction. The installed upgrade kit allows for confidence of use at any range, but at the same time, the weapon is widely known for its high price due to the very expensive components included in the kit.\n \n
