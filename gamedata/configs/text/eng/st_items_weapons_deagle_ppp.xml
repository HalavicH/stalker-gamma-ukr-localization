		<text>A more modernized version of the Desert Eagle, with a built-in compensator and picatinny rails on the frame and slide. It still has quite a recoil but much lower than any other Desert Eagle, let alone magnum. The slight barrel improvements also improve the accuracy and allow the use of some scopes. It seems to be of relatively new shape, but looking at the slide and the magazine, it claims to use .50AE and yet it's feeding on .357 Magnum. Without a doubt, it was modified right in The Zone.\n \n
