		<text>The Fort-12 is an attempt for recently-independent Ukraine (from August 1991) to create its own police pistol to replace the Soviet-era Makarov PM while still using the same 9x18 caliber. Designed in 1995 and developed in 1998 by Ukrainian firearms designer RPC Fort, this is a formidable pistol considered to be an upgrade of the PM itself. Although it may have reliability issues, especially due to the lack of a safe decocking facility, it compensates with accuracy, magazine size and ergonomics. This model comes with a threaded barrel, allowing the attachment of a suppressor.\n \n

		<text>The Fort-17 pistol is the latest development of the Ukrainian state owned FORT factory. It is a polymer framed modification of the earlier Fort-12 pistol. All the mechanisms and properties are almost identical between the two pistols. However, the Fort-17 is lighter than its predecessor and features a removable grip backstrap for better comfort.\n \n
