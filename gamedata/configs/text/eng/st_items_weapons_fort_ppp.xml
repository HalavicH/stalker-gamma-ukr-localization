		<text>The Fort-12 is an attempt for recently-independent Ukraine (from August 1991) to create its own police pistol to replace the Soviet-era Makarov PM, while still using the same 9x18 caliber. Designed in 1995 and developed in 1998 by Ukrainian firearms designer RPC Fort, this is a formidable pistol considered to be an upgrade of the PM itself. Although it may have reliability issues, especially due to the lack of the safe decocking facility, it compensates for the accuracy, magazine and ergonomics. This model comes with a threaded barrel, allowing it to equip silencers by default. \n \n

		<text>The Fort-17 is an improvement of the Fort-12. By replacing the frame from steel to polymer, the weight is decreased, although the recoil might be just a little bit worse. Comes with magazines size 13 by default instead of 12 or 13. It also has a removable grip backstrap, which can improve ergonomics.\n \n

		<text>The Fort-21.01 is a copy of the Jericho 941 manufactured by "RPC Fort", made after making a contract with "Israel Military Industries" in September 2009. Considering its relatively "new" status, especially in The Zone, it is a rather rare pistol, hence the price. It is modeled upon the CZ-75, in which case both can share their respective 16-rounds magazines. It uses 9x19 caliber instead of 9x18 unlike its older brothers, the Fort-12 and Fort-17. This model also seems to come with some aftermarket sights attachments with an intricate Green and Red Tritium dots design.\n \n
