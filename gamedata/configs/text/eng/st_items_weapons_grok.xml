		<text>The RAPTR is an automatic mag–fed shotgun born in the Zone and tailored to the specific needs of that dangerous part of the world. The RAPTR is often called "Bloodsucker Killer" by stalkers. Indeed, its high rate of fire, large magazine and unparalleled ergonomics makes it the perfect weapon to kill the fast moving and invisible beasts. Mainly considered as a fancy gun–nut weapon, the RAPTR popularity among stalkers started to raise during the recent bloodsucker nest bloom. It is now considered as one of the finest 12x70mm guns in the Zone.\n \n
