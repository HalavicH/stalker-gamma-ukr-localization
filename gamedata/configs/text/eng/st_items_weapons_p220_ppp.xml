	<string id="st_wpn_sig229_descr">
		<text>The P229 is a compact-sized, 9mm caliber chambered, upgraded P228 meant for police duty and conceal-carry. Since this is the "LEGION" variant, it's safe to assume that this is a marvel among the Western factions like the Mercenaries. Despite being chambered in the weaker 9mm instead of the stronger .45 ACP, it's still a relatively good, small pistol for those that prefer a SIG-Sauer that shoots 9mm instead of .45 ACP.\n \n

		<text>A very recent addition to the SIG-Sauer pistols chambered in 9mm. It uses a "Strike-Action" mechanism, which should heavily reduce recoil even if rechambered to .45 ACP. It has unmatched reliability, very good accuracy and perfect recoil. The wonderful pistol in the field.\n \n
