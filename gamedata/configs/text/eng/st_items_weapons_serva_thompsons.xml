	<string id="st_wpn_thompson_m1a1_descr">
		<text>The Thompson is a blowback-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed selective-fire submachine gun.\n
		This variant of the Thompson has a significantly reduced fire-rate and a simplified design produced on request of the US Army. As a result, the Blish lock, oiling system and compensator were removed. Despite having a slower fire-rate, the gun is much worse to shoot than the 1921.\n This variant also has a different receiver than the 1921/1928 variant and thus will not accept drum mags\n \n
