	<string id="st_wpn_vityaznew_descr">
		<text>A variant of the PP-19 with a 30-round magazine chambered for 9x19mm, designed in 2004. It is based on and shares many commonalities with the AK-74 but is directly developed from the PP-19 Bizon. It is used by patrol groups, Russian traffic police, Russian security police, and by units of the MVD. "Vityaz" is Russian for "knight". This is the "SN" variant, which means it has a railed dust cover but no dove-tail side rail, therefore it can use NATO scopes but not Warsaw Pact scopes.\n \n
