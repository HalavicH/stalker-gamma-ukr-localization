		The Operator variant adds a Zenitco DTK-1L muzzle break requiring an advanced silencer. Furhtermore it sports an EOTECH Vudu 1-6x24 FFP rifle scope. The EOTECH Speed Ring reticle allows for fast target engagement at low power, but at higher power provides the resolution and accuracy required to tackle longer shots. The Vudu 1-6X is the perfect solution for short- to medium-range applications. \n \n
