            Designed to further improve on Colt Defense's aging M4 Carbine, the HK416 was the
            response to the US Army's Delta Force need for a better caliber than 9x19mm and
            something shorter than the M4 Carbine. This particular model is the A7 variant,
            currently used by the German KSK and KSM forces. As it is only available to western
            military personnel, this weapon is often wielded by members of the Syndicate and
            other PMCs around the Zone.
