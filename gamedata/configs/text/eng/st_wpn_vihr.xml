		<text>The SR-3 "Vikhr" ("Whirlwind") compact assault rifle was developed in CNIITochMash and manufactured by Tula Arms Plant. Initially known as "MA" (Malogabaritnyj Avtomat - small size assault rifle), it was based on the suppressed 9x39mm AS-Val assault rifle, and intended for concealed carry by special VIP protection teams and State Security operatives, SR3M Vikhr is result of combining the qualities of SR-3, AS VAL and VSS Vintorez. SR-3M also has a larger capacity of 30 rounds, which also provides more reliable feeding during automatic fire.\n \n
