            The 9A91 is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilises a long stroke
            gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The
            receiver is made from steel stampings, the forend and pistol grip are made from
            polymer. The steel stock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The
            flip up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 metres range, but the relatively
            short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet restricts the 9A-91
            to ranges of about 100 metres.

            The VSK-94 is a 9x39mm suppressed sniper rifle developed by the Russian KBP
            Instrument Design Bureau as a low-cost alternative to the VSS rifle. The rifle
            is based on the 9A-91 carbine. The VSK-94 was designed to accurately engage
            unarmoured targets at ranges up to 400m.
