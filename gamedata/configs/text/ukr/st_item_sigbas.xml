            Renowned for its high production quality and good performance, the SG 550 is
            often referred to as the finest 5.56 mm rifle ever made. It has a side-folding
            skeletonised buttstock and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves
            in the lower handguard.

            A Swiss made SIG SG-550 assault rifle. Although it isn't new, it is clear that
            the previous owner took good care of it: the weapon has been taken apart and put
            back together with every component fine-tuned for optimum performance,
            increasing stopping power. The letter "S" has been carved into the stock, along
            with 16 small notches.
