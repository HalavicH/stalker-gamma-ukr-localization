	<string id="st_wpn_sr25_descr">
		<text>The SR-25 was developed by Reed Knight, owner of Knights Armament Co. and Eugene Stoner. The SR-25 is an AR-15 rifle scaled up to shoot 7.62x51mm NATO or .308. 60% of parts in the rifle are interchangeable with AR-15 components. This rifle sold well among civilian shooters who needed an accurate semi-automatic rifle for hunting or target shooting. This rifle also found a favour in the US Military. Because of the AR-15-style recoil buffer, which extends rearwards from the receiver, the SR-25 cannot be fitted with a folding stock and instead is fitted with a telescoping stock.\n \n

		<text>Intended for professional and amateur hunting, the TOZ-34 is an over/under shotgun.
