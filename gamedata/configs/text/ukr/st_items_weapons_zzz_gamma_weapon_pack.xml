            Intended for professional and amateur hunting, the TOZ-34 is an over/under
            shotgun. Affordable in price with high damage output and its ability to unload
            both rounds instantly make it a popular weapon among rookies on the outskirts of
            the Zone. Especially useful against mutants thanks to its accuracy and stopping
            power.

            efficient gun to hunt large mutants like Chimeras, hence the name.
