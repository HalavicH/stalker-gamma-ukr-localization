   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Sound Attribute Viewer and Tweaker -- Help
================================================================

SAVandT is meant to make the STALKER sound modder's world a bit 
easier. 

There are two common ways to adapt a sound file for use
in STALKER.  Either one must have the existing .wav version 
of the file for use in the STALKER SDK (software development 
kit) in order to edit the parameters and create an updated, 
compatible .ogg file with valid checksum, or one must use a 
hex-editor on an existing .ogg file, overwriting or inserting 
a few bytes, then run an external program to fix up the 
checksum for the changed file.

SAVandT provides a third way:  Load the .ogg file into SAVandT,
view/change the attributes, and save your changes.  That's it. 

================================================================
                      * LIMITATIONS *
================================================================
This is not a sound editor.  It cannot change the number of 
channels used (should be one for STALKER-SoC), the sampling 
rate, the decoding bitrate, or any part of the sound itself. 
You should use an external program like Audacity to do that, 
and perhaps create the initial .ogg version with the SDK.
(See note on Audacity below.)

This is also not a database extractor.  That functionality is 
available separately.  Sounds must be stand-alone .ogg files 
before SAVandT can view/change them.

While this program will correct existing CRC errors in the 
sound comment header block "page", it will ONLY correct those. 
If CRC errors exist on other pages, something may be wrong 
with the sound.  You might be able to use an external program 
to correct those, but you should probably re-create the sound 
with the appropriate tools like those mentioned above.

You must ensure that the program has write permission for the 
directories containing the sound files you wish to update. 
It is possible that Virtual Store issues in Vista and Windows 7 
(and XP if not running as admin) can result in changed files 
that you can see in Windows Explorer, but are not visible to 
the STALKER program.  A possible workaround is to leave the 
"Rename Originals as .bak" checkbox checked.

In this version, you cannot update files greater than 10 MB
in size.
================================================================

                    Using the Program

You can execute the program in Windows by clicking on it. 
This help file is accessible by clicking the Help button on 
the program's main window just to the left of the About 
button.  ("About" displays info on the folks behind SAVandT.)

================================================================
The "Select Sound Directory" Button, the Sound File Listbox

In the upper left of the program window exists the "Select 
Drive/Directory" button.  Click it to navigate via the Open 
dialog to a drive and directory containing the sound files 
(in Ogg Vorbis format) that you wish to view/change.

Once a suitable directory is selected, the directory name is 
displayed on a panel below the button and a list of files 
ending in ".ogg" are displayed in the list on the left side 
of the window along with any subdirectories present.

Select a sound file for viewing/editing by single-clicking it 
or by using the arrow keys. 

Highlight a directory by single-clicking it or by using the 
arrow keys to move through the choices.  Double-click the 
directory entry or press the Enter key while it is highlighted 
to change to that directory.  The parent directory is indicated 
by "<dir>  .." (a pair of periods).

Selecting a file loads it into the program and displays info 
on the right side of the window.  If a problem occurs while 
attempting to read a file, it will be displayed in a special 
status bar at the lower right of the window.

Tip:  If you add to or change the contents of the selected 
directory outside of the program, you can quickly refresh the 
directory listing by ctrl-clicking the directory path display 
panel.

You can combine steps by selecting a .ogg sound file in the 
dialog directly.

When a file is selected, it is read and scrutinized (AKA 
"parsed").  If it is a valid STALKER sound file, the fields 
will be populated with the attribute data.

If it is a valid Ogg Vorbis file, it will automatically be 
adapted to be a STALKER sound file with default data.  While 
this can be saved immediately, you should examine/change the 
info first to suit your purposes before saving.

If the file loaded has a bad CRC-32 checksum but the STALKER 
comment section is okay, you will have a chance to save the 
file with a corrected checksum.

Tip: New with 1.1: You can click on the file name label above 
the edit boxes to play the valid Ogg sound with Ogg-player 
that you have installed on your PC.  Note that the sound 
attributes are only used by the STALKER games and not your 
player.

================================================================
The Attribute Fields and Comboboxes

SAVandT presents the info in fields and comboboxes with more 
"meaning" than hex data.  Hover over these objects to see 
the pop-up hints.

Selecting the Sound File Info combobox will display some 
details about the sound itself.  These characteristics are 
shown to inform you; they cannot be changed by SAVandT.

The Game Sound Type drop-down combobox shows the current 
game type assigned to the sound.  These types determine how 
the sound will be perceived by NPCs and mutants in the game. 
This can be changed to make NPCs aware of crate breakage, for 
example.  Normally the selected sound type should correspond 
to the actual sound (e.g., ak74_shot_1.ogg should be set to 
weapon_shooting, not item_taking), but some choices could 
improve gameplay.

A sound type of "undefined" is not considered to be an error. 
Change it if that is not what you want.  Test your changes; 
while NPCs don't react to some types, they do to others.

The Base Sound Volume field contains the default volume of 
the sound in game at the position of the sound source.  It is 
typically set to 1.0.  The range is from 0.0 to 2.0.  Values 
higher than 1.0 are not recommended; the game might try to 
play a sound at a volume higher than this setting.

The Minimum Distance field holds the distance in meters from 
the sound source at which you can still hear it at 100% volume. 
The volume will drop off from there to zero at the Maximum 
Distance.

The Maximum Distance is the distance from the sound source in 
meters at which you will no longer be able to hear the sound.

The Maximum AI Distance is the distance from the sound source 
(in meters) at which NPCs will no longer be able to hear the 
sound.  This is the value that can be tweaked on many sounds 
to reduce (or even increase) the perception of the NPCs to the 
sounds to promote gameplay.

Note that the type of sound also determines whether the NPC 
will react to the sound at all.

================================================================
The Apply Button

After editing a sound's attributes, clicking the Apply button 
will automatically recalculate the CRC-32 checksum for the 
comment/setup header page in the sound file and then update 
the file on disk.

The resulting file should be usable in STALKER immediately.

If the "Rename Originals to .bak" checkbox is checked, the 
original sound file is first renamed by appending ".bak", 
unless a backup file by that name already exists.

Shift-click the Apply button to bring up the File Save dialog 
in order to save the file under a different name.  If you 
save to a different directory, the original working directory 
is kept.

Some files cannot be updated until you change the situation. 
Examples include: read-only, locked, no write permission.

================================================================
The Revert Button

Use this button to undo all of your attribute changes made to 
the current sound file image, even if you have saved changes. 
This does not update the file on disk, just the image of the 
sound in memory.

It does not affect programmatic "fix-ups" like comment 
structure insertion.

================================================================
The Copy Button

When a valid sound file image is loaded into memory, you can 
copy its attributes for pasting into another sound file image. 
The copy is made from the data currently displayed, which of 
course includes any changes.

The copy buffer will remain valid until you exit the program.

================================================================
The Paste Button

This will restore the contents of the attributes paste buffer 
into the current sound image.  You can use this with the Copy 
button to copy/paste attributes for similar sounds (e.g., 
weapon draw).

================================================================
Note:

You can use Audacity with SAVandT to completely bypass the SDK. 
I was able to "do it all" in creating and editing sounds for 
STALKER With just Audacity version 1.3.13 beta and SAVandT.

Load or record a sound file in Audacity.  Be sure the settings 
are STALKER-compatible for the game you are playing, typically
monaural 16-bit data sampled at 44100 Hz.  Audacity can convert 
sampling rates for you.

Audacity can also read Ogg Vorbis files directly.  Tip:  If 
importing .ogg files, you might benefit by exporting twice: 
Once in the same quality as the source file, and one at the 
quality you want for the game.  Future edits should use the 
higher quality file as a starting point.  Repeated imports of 
Ogg Vorbis files followed by exports that overwrite the original 
files can reduce the sound quality.

To save the sound file, "Export..." it to Ogg Vorbis, using the 
Options button on the Export File dialog to set the Quality 
(0 = 48 kbps, the STALKER default quality).  If the preference 
is set, you can enter custom comments during save; otherwise 
use the File > Metadata Editor to add them.

You will need to add (or re-add, if editing a STALKER .ogg 
sound file) the STALKER sound attributes with SAVandT.  Tip: 
Use SAVandT's Copy/Paste functionality to transfer the settings 
from the original .ogg file to the edited version.
